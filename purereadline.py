# This module makes GNU readline available to Python.  It has ideas
# contributed by Lee Busby, LLNL, and William Magro, Cornell Theory
# Center.  The completer interface was inspired by Lele Gaifax.  More
# recently, it was largely rewritten by Guido van Rossum.

# This is a pure Python wrapper around `readine.c` which uses `ctypes`.

# parse_and_bind(*args)
# =====================
# The GNU readline `rl_parse_and_bind` takes <char *s>, a pointer to a string.
# Python-readline uses `PyArg_parseTuple` with the "s" formatter to check for
# <str> or <unicode> args and converts them to <char *>, then copies the pointer
# (s) and passes the copy to libreadline.
